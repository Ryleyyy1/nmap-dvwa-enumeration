# Nmap Web Enumeration – DVWA Lab

## Overview
This repository documents a **web server enumeration assessment** conducted
using **Nmap and Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** against **Damn Vulnerable Web
Application (DVWA)** in a controlled and authorized lab environment.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate reconnaissance techniques,
enumeration methodology, and security analysis skills commonly used in
web penetration testing.
