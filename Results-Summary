## Results Summary

The Nmap-based web enumeration identified an active HTTP service running on
port 80 with the following key findings:

- **Open Service**
  - Port 80/tcp is open and running **Apache HTTP Server 2.4.65 (Debian)**

- **Server Information Disclosure**
  - Web server version and operating system details are exposed via HTTP headers
  - Default Apache page is accessible, indicating lack of server hardening

- **Supported HTTP Methods**
  - Allowed methods: **GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS**
  - Methods such as POST may increase risk if input validation is not properly implemented

- **Exposed Endpoint**
  - The endpoint **`/server-status/`** was discovered during directory enumeration
  - This endpoint may leak server activity and resource information if not access-restricted

These findings indicate **information disclosure risks** and **insufficient web server hardening**,
which may increase the attack surface for further exploitation.
